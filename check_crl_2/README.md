Explanation of the code:

The script first imports the necessary libraries: datetime, requests, and OpenSSL.crypto.
The URL of the CRL file is stored in the crl_url variable, and a GET request is made to download the data using the requests library.
The CRL data is parsed using the OpenSSL.crypto.load_crl method and stored in the crl variable.
The current UTC time is stored in the now variable.
The next_update field from the CRL is decoded and converted to a datetime object using datetime.datetime.strptime.
The is_valid variable is set to True if the next_update_datetime is after the now time.
Finally, the script prints whether the CRL is valid or not.
Note: You'll need to install the pyopenssl and cryptography libraries to run this script. You can do this using pip: pip install pyopenssl cryptography.
