This script uses the urllib.request library to download the CRL file from the provided URL. It then uses the OpenSSL.crypto library to load the CRL file into OpenSSL and extract the valid-to time. Finally, it checks if the valid-to time is in the future using datetime.datetime.now(), and returns a message indicating if the CRL is valid or expired.

Note that you'll need to have the pyOpenSSL library installed in your AWS Lambda environment for this script to work. You can do this by including pyOpenSSL in your Lambda function deployment package or using a Lambda layer that includes the library.
