This code sends a GET request to the CRL URL and parses the response text to find the "NextUpdate" line, which contains the "valid to" time. It then converts this time string to a Python datetime object and compares it to the current UTC time to see if it is in the future. If the "valid to" time is in the future, it prints a message saying that the CRL is valid until that time. Otherwise, it prints a message saying that the CRL is not valid.
